  - `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
  - `tidy.txt` - Output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
  - `README.md` - This file.

### Getting started

  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file.
  2. Make sure the [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called `UCI HAR Dataset`. Please note the the code is written for Windows; if using a different OS you may need to change the method to "curl" when dowloading the dataset.
  3. Make sure you have installed reshape2 package  
  4. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
